# Build instructions
In order to build this a Curseforge API key will need to be provided in [Assets/settings.json](SMAPIModManager/Assets/settings.json) as so

```
{
  "api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

You can acquire an API key by creating a Curseforge for Studios account [here](https://console.curseforge.com/#/signup) and logging in to the [developer console](https://console.curseforge.com/#/api-keys)

Open the project in Visual Studio with .Net tools installed, wait for errors to clear after NuGet packages have installed and click run
